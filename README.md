Testing and Automation

This project will be used to test if all the features on the connected office website works as intended, if given input the correct output must be produced.
The program will generate a report to indicate which tests paased and which did not.
Firstly the test will be run to open a browser and to access the website.
After on the right website the test will check if the login button and page works as intended.
After a succesfull login the home page will be loaded.
On the home page there are 3 sections and a logout button.
The records of the Categories will be created, reviewed, updated and afterwards deleted.
The records of the Zones will be created, reviewed, updated and afterwards deleted.
The records of the Devices will be created, reviewed, updated and afterwards deleted.

If all the tests pass to created edit review and delete all the sections' records, the tests will return to the home screen and do a program state test, if this test passes the program will log out to ensure the tests can be run again and if needed adjustments can be made.

(I initialy used my own data for all the sections to run the tests, just to better understand how UiPath functions, I only afterwards used the data from the given excel file)
